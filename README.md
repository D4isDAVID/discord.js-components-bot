# Discord.js Components Bot

This is a [discord.js] bot template with a components system.
It is written in [TypeScript], and uses [`@discordjs/core`][@discordjs/core].

Out of the box, the template only adds a ping and some example commands.
Database support is also not included by default, and can be manually added.

## Key Features

### Components System

Typically when developing Discord bots, we place handlers, events, commands,
interactions, etc. into their own respective folders.

The components system creates a more organized way to store all related
events, commands and other interactions in their own folder
([see components](./src/components/)).

### Interaction Utilities

The template comes with interaction utilities, allowing you to handle user
input with ease ([see `interactions.ts`](./src/components/interactions.ts)).

### Subcommand Utilities

The template comes with subcommand utilities, allowing you to create commands
with subcommands and subcommand groups with ease
([see example](./src/components/example/commands/subcommands.ts)).

## Configuration

- Make a copy of the [`.env.example`](./.env.example) file
- Name the new copy `.env`
- Configure the file
